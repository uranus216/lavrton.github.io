Deployment to heroku was not very hard. I started from there [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction). Then VERY helpful article about `heroku` and `sailsjs`: [http://brentvatne.ca/deploy-sails-to-heroku/](http://brentvatne.ca/deploy-sails-to-heroku/).

Now current version is available here: [http://trackerio.herokuapp.com/](http://trackerio.herokuapp.com/).

Now I need to create first useful version, so I'd like to start to use it by myself.
