First I created GitHub repo for the project. Repository is stored here: [https://github.com/lavrton/tracker](https://github.com/lavrton/tracker).

For a long time I was thinking about design. I am not a designer. It is really hard to me to work with css and huge html files. So bootstap looks very nice there. Also I found a lot of nice admin templates. But I want to build application with ReactJS, so using bootstrap (with jquery) is a bad idea (may be). I found bootstrap-react project. Don't want to use it.

So I was searching for a new css framework. One of the first was Pure in google search "css framework". Do you know what? It looks pretty nice and it has a lot of stars on github...

But I also found topcoat frameworks. And it looks awesome.

So I installed SailsJS framework, topcoat, react. I was very sad when I knew that WebStorm doesn't support `.jsx`!

Now I have to think more about first features and design.
