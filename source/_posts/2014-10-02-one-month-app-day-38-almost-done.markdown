A I have a little bit failed with time management.

I made a break for two weeks while developing project. I thought that I had a lot of time. At the 25th of September (before last day) I thought that 2 last days are perfect for finishing the main work. But now it is the 38th day of my project. And I still think the same way. Just 2 more days to make work done. Oops....


Currently application looks this way:

{% img center /images/dash-3.png  %}

List of inputs is a new "Purposes module". With this technique I have to write ~10 life purposes (long-term and short-term as well).

There are 2 tasks to do:

* Implement chooser for "bestOf". (at last day of a week I have to choose "bestOf" event from 7 days)
* Work with style to make better look of application .
