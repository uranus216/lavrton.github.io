# Finishing project

Now I am finishing "One Month Project".

I have to remove "bestOf" module from application because there are TOO MANY thing should be implemented there. But I am already late.
So my application has two main modules:

1. Chain
2. Daily purposes

# Conclusion

At the start I was really inspired by my application. And I thought that I had a lot of time. But I hadn't. I didn't know how much work should I do with all modules.

Thoughts:

1. One month - is too long interval for such project. I mean it is better to have a short interval - and it will be much easier to setup tasks and deadlines.
2. `React` is awesome! It is really different approach for building UI instead I was using before.
3. `Sails` is awesome too! I have set up realtime REST API too fast.

Now project is working there: [http://trackerio.herokuapp.com/](http://trackerio.herokuapp.com/)

Source code is there: [https://github.com/lavrton/tracker](https://github.com/lavrton/tracker)

I will not stop to develop the project. I still want to implement "bestOf" module.

# Using

Right now I am using application it this way:

1. After breakfast I sit down at the computer and write ~10 long-term and short-term purposes such as: "Finish One Month project", "Visit Europe country", "financial comfort - make cool project", "Have nice body - workouts". As you can see in two last examples I try to write purposes in this pattern: "What I want - What should I do".
2. Before sleep I mark "chains" I have done.
