I spent a lot of time to discover sails framework. It looks like they are refactoring documentation pages. So it is really hard to find information. Many links are broken. Google and stackoverflow help me and I don't really like it.

Now I am on sketching state.

First module "daily report":
{% img center /images/dash-sketch-1.jpg  %}

<!--more-->

Then "storyline". It includes instagram, twitter (thinking about other services) messages:
{% img center /images/storyline-sketch-1.jpg  %}
