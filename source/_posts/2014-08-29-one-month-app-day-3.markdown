Today I was learning React work flow. It looks very easy. Documentation and examples are ample.

But I have some problems with SailsJS. Randomly I found how to create new models. Now I need to sync server and client models. It is very easy to read all models from server. But how to config listening of creating new models? I need an immediately notification to client side via socket. I need more time to learn it.
