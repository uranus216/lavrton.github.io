## Inspiration

Why am I doing this application? I love GitHub's streaks and it's calendar widget. It motivates me a lot to make some new open source stuff. I liked ["don't break the chain"](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) technique. I tried several services. But the technique has a HUGE DEMOTIVATION part when you break the chain. But calendar (as in GitHub) still motivates me. Because I don't want to save a chain only. I am also trying to make calendar as green, as possible. Breaking a chain is not very demotivating.

Inspired by apps:

* [https://chains.cc/](https://chains.cc/)
* https://routinetap.com/ (not available now)
* [http://aprilzero.com/](http://aprilzero.com/) and I am waiting his [https://gyrosco.pe/](https://gyrosco.pe/) application.

    I thought to add "number tracking" (such as how many hours did I work today?), but now I'm thinking it is really hard to track such questions manually. It looks like [https://gyrosco.pe/](https://gyrosco.pe/) will help to track such data automatically. Boolean questions ("Have I done a fitness?") are easier. Just done or not.

## BestOf technique

Every day I should write what is the best or the most important has happened to me during the day. For example: finishing project ABC, participating in paintball tournament, had meeting with parents, etc. Sometimes I have very bad "bestOf" daily report, such as "was in the shop". That means the day was bad for self-development.

Then when a week is over I have to choose one "bestOf" event of the week from 7 days. Then "bestOf" for a month, a quarter, and a year. This report is very interesting for me. Ones I had "was in the shop" bestOf for the week. The week was awful. So I had to make my next week better.

Also it is really interesting to watch results for a year! Many cool things are forgotten and memories can motivate me again. 

Additionally one person suggested me "day score" technique. With "bestOf" for a day I am adding special score - color from red to green. Red - very bad day, yellow - usual day, green - good day, dark green - AWESOME day. And it is nice technique. Because sometimes you may have no interesting "bestOf" events, but the day might be still very good, for example spending very good time with children.

In 2013 I was storing this information in Evernote. In 2014 I started to use mind map [Slash System](http://slash-system.com).

Maybe special software will be more comfortable, so I want to develop it, and try to use. But I still think about interface.
